About Serbizyu
Our Story
Serbizyu was born from a simple observation: finding reliable local services in the Philippines is harder than it should be. Whether you need someone to fix your laptop, tutor your child, or clean your home, the process often involves endless phone calls, uncertain pricing, and questions about trustworthiness.
We built Serbizyu to change that.
Our platform connects customers with skilled service providers in a transparent, secure, and efficient way. With features like structured workflows, escrow payments, and real-time updates, we're making local services work the way they should—simple, safe, and satisfying for everyone.

Our Mission
To empower local service providers and make quality services accessible to everyone.
We believe talented people are everywhere, but opportunities aren't. Serbizyu creates a level playing field where anyone with skills can build a business, and anyone who needs help can find it easily.

What Makes Us Different
🎯 Workflow System
Unlike other platforms, we don't just connect people—we guide them through the entire work process. Structured workflows ensure clear expectations, progress tracking, and quality results.
🔒 Secure Payments
Money is held safely in escrow until work is completed. Both buyers and sellers are protected, reducing risk and building trust.
⚡ Real-Time Everything
See updates the moment they happen. New messages, order changes, workflow progress—all instant, no refresh needed.
📱 Mobile-First Design
Built for the way Filipinos actually use the internet—on their phones. Fast, responsive, and data-efficient.
💬 Built-In Communication
No need for separate chat apps. Everything you need to discuss is right there in the order page.
⭐ Transparent Reviews
Honest feedback from real users helps everyone make better decisions. Reviews are permanent and publicly visible.

Our Values

Quality
Good enough isn't good enough. We push for excellence in every service, every interaction, every line of code.

No hidden fees. No surprise charges. No unclear terms. What you see is what you get.
