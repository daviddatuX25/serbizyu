## Project Overview

This is a Laravel project that appears to be a service marketplace application. It uses a domain-driven design approach, with clear separation of concerns between different domains like `Listings` and `Users`. The application includes features like user authentication, service listings, open offers, and a creator space. The front-end is built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Alpine.js.

## Project Progress

### Completed Tasks:

**System Architecture Analysis - Already Implemented:**
*   User authentication (Laravel Breeze)

*   Set up `routes/api.php` with web middleware (use session auth)
*   Configure CORS in `config/cors.php`
*   Add API rate limiting
*   Create response helper traits
*   Test JSON error responses

**Phase 1: Foundation & Core API - Milestone 1.2: Categories API [5/6]:**
*   Create `CategoryController` API (and moved to `app/Domains/Listings/Http/Controllers/Api`)
*   Add routes: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE `/api/categories`
*   Add filtering/search query parameters
*   Create `CategoryResource` and `CategoryCollection` (and moved to `app/Domains/Listings/Http/Resources`)
*   Add authorization (admin only for write) with `CategoryPolicy` (and moved to `app/Domains/Listings/Policies`)

### Our Approach & Key Learnings

Our development process has been a collaborative and iterative one, with a strong emphasis on adhering to the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). We've established a set of development guidelines to ensure consistency and maintainability, which are documented in this file. A key part of our workflow is to ensure that all new components (Controllers, Policies, Resources, etc.) are placed in their respective domain directories.

A significant portion of our recent efforts has been dedicated to configuring the testing environment, specifically for running feature tests with a `testing.sqlite` database in a Laravel Sail setup on Windows. This has been a challenging process, and we've encountered and worked through several issues, including:

*   **Database Connection Errors:** Persistent `QueryException` errors due to the test environment attempting to connect to the MySQL database instead of the configured SQLite database.
*   **Configuration Loading:** Difficulties in ensuring that the `php artisan test` command correctly loads the testing environment configuration from `phpunit.xml` and `.env.testing`.
*   **Syntax Errors:** Accidental introduction of syntax errors in configuration files during our attempts to resolve the database connection issues.

Through persistent problem-solving, we've explored various solutions, including modifying `phpunit.xml`, `.env.testing`, `config/database.php`, and `config/cache.php`. The key takeaway is the importance of a robust and explicit configuration for the testing environment, especially in a complex setup like Laravel Sail on Windows. We also learned the importance of clearing the configuration cache (`php artisan config:clear`) after making changes to configuration files to ensure that the changes are applied.

### Next Steps

1.  **Run `CategoryApiTest.php`:** With the recent fixes to the configuration files, the next immediate step is to run the `CategoryApiTest.php` and ensure all tests pass. The tests that need to pass are:
    *   `test_guest_cannot_create_category`
    *   `test_regular_user_cannot_create_category`
    *   `test_admin_can_create_category`
    *   `test_categories_can_be_listed`
    *   `test_categories_can_be_listed_with_search_filter`
    *   `test_specific_category_can_be_retrieved`
    *   `test_guest_cannot_update_category`
    *   `test_regular_user_cannot_update_category`
    *   `test_admin_can_update_category`
    *   `test_guest_cannot_delete_category`
    *   `test_regular_user_cannot_delete_category`
    *   `test_admin_can_delete_category`

2.  **Complete Milestone 1.2:** Once the tests are passing, we will have completed the backend development for the Categories API. The final step for this milestone will be to mark it as complete in this `GEMINI.md` file.

3.  **Proceed to Milestone 1.3: Services API & UI Enhancement:** After completing Milestone 1.2, we will move on to the next milestone, which includes:
    *   Creating the `ServiceController` API.
    *   Adding routes for services CRUD.
    *   Implementing image uploads for services.
    *   Creating the `ServiceResource`.

This detailed plan will allow us to pick up where we left off and continue making progress efficiently in our next session.

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

*   PHP >= 8.2
*   Node.js and npm
*   Composer

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install PHP dependencies: `composer install`
3.  Install front-end dependencies: `npm install`
4.  Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`: `cp .env.example .env`
5.  Generate an application key: `php artisan key:generate`
6.  Configure your database in the `.env` file.
7.  Run database migrations and seed the database: `php artisan migrate --seed`

### Development

To start the development servers for both the back-end and front-end, run the following command:

```bash
composer run-script dev
```

This will start the Laravel development server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and the Vite development server on `http://localhost:5173`.

### Testing

To run the test suite, use the following command:

```bash
composer test
```

## Development Conventions

*   **Domain-Driven Design:** The application follows a domain-driven design approach, with services and models organized into domains.
*   **Service Layer:** Business logic is encapsulated in service classes.
*   **Blade Components:** The front-end uses Blade components for reusable UI elements.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling.
*   **Alpine.js:** Alpine.js is used for front-end interactivity.

*   **Clarification First:** Before implementing any feature or making a change, take a moment to clarify the requirements with the user. This ensures that we are building the right thing and avoids rework later. This is a crucial step to ensure we build everything right and well, even if it takes a little more time upfront.

*   **Domain-Centric Architecture:** Strictly adhere to the domain-driven design for all new files and modifications. Policies, HTTP controllers, form requests, and other related components must be placed within their respective domain directories (e.g., `app/Domains/Listings/Policies`, `app/Domains/Listings/Http/Controllers`, `app/Domains/Listings/Http/Requests`).
*   **Confidence Threshold:** Before making any changes, ensure you have at least 95% confidence in the approach and implementation. If unsure, ask follow-up questions for clarification.
*   **Domain-Driven Design Adherence:** Always prioritize adhering to the established Domain-Driven Design principles and project structure. New features and modifications should fit naturally within the existing domain boundaries.
*   **Master Plan First:** Refer to the 'Master Plan' as the primary source for tasks and priorities. Address items in the plan before considering new additions, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
*   **Clarification:** If any part of a task or instruction is unclear, ambiguous, or requires further detail, always ask follow-up questions to gain full understanding before proceeding.
*   **Testing:** For every new feature or bug fix, ensure appropriate unit and feature tests are written to verify correctness and prevent regressions. Tests are a permanent part of the codebase.
*   **Code Conventions:** Strictly follow existing code style, formatting, naming conventions, and architectural patterns observed in the project.
*   **Incremental Changes:** Prefer making small, focused, and verifiable changes. Avoid large, sweeping modifications that are difficult to review and debug.

## 📝 Technical Decisions Made

### Stack Confirmation
- **Backend:** Laravel 12.28.1 + PHP 8.2+
- **Frontend:** Blade + Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** MySQL 8.0+
- **Cache:** Redis
- **Queue:** Redis
- **Real-time:** Laravel Broadcasting + Pusher/Laravel WebSockets
- **Payments:** Xendit (primary choice for Philippines)

### Architecture Patterns
- Domain-Driven Design (existing structure)
- Service Layer for business logic
- Policy-based authorization
- Event-driven for real-time features
- Queue-based for async tasks

### Key Business Rules
- **Platform Fee:** Added on top of service price (e.g., 5%)
- **Payment Flow:** Buyer pays (price + fee) → Escrow → Released to seller (price - 0) after completion
- **Refunds:** Manual bank transfers for now
- **Cancellation:** Allowed only if no work started (no activity in WorkInstance)
- **Verification:** Manual review by admin/moderator
- **Disputes:** Simple system with admin resolution

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

## Project Overview

This is a Laravel project that appears to be a service marketplace application. It uses a domain-driven design approach, with clear separation of concerns between different domains like `Listings` and `Users`. The application includes features like user authentication, service listings, open offers, and a creator space. The front-end is built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Alpine.js.

## Project Progress

### Completed Tasks:

**System Architecture Analysis - Already Implemented:**
*   User authentication (Laravel Breeze)
*   Domain structure (Users, Common, Listings)
*   Service layer architecture
*   Exception handling (Custom domain exceptions)
*   Models: User, Address, UserAddress, Service, OpenOffer, OpenOfferBid

*   Services: OpenOfferService, OpenOfferBidService, WorkflowTemplateService
*   Services: WorkTemplateService, WorkCatalogService, ListingImageService
*   Seeders: All core data seeded
*   Views: Home, Browse, Auth pages (Blade)
*   Components: Navbar, Form components, Modal
*   CSS: Tailwind with custom components
*   Alpine.js: Interactive components

**Phase 1: Foundation & Core API - Milestone 1.1: API Infrastructure Setup:**

*   Update `app/Exceptions/Handler.php` for JSON error responses
*   Create `app/Http/Middleware/ForceJsonResponse.php`
*   Set up `routes/api.php` with web middleware (use session auth)
*   Configure CORS in `config/cors.php`
*   Add API rate limiting
*   Create response helper traits
*   Test JSON error responses

**Phase 1: Foundation & Core API - Milestone 1.2: Categories API [5/6]:**
*   Create `CategoryController` API (and moved to `app/Domains/Listings/Http/Controllers/Api`)
*   Add routes: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE `/api/categories`
*   Add filtering/search query parameters
*   Create `CategoryResource` and `CategoryCollection` (and moved to `app/Domains/Listings/Http/Resources`)
*   Add authorization (admin only for write) with `CategoryPolicy` (and moved to `app/Domains/Listings/Policies`)

### Our Approach & Key Learnings

Our development process has been a collaborative and iterative one, with a strong emphasis on adhering to the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). We've established a set of development guidelines to ensure consistency and maintainability, which are documented in this file. A key part of our workflow is to ensure that all new components (Controllers, Policies, Resources, etc.) are placed in their respective domain directories.

A significant portion of our recent efforts has been dedicated to configuring the testing environment, specifically for running feature tests with a `testing.sqlite` database in a Laravel Sail setup on Windows. This has been a challenging process, and we've encountered and worked through several issues, including:

*   **Database Connection Errors:** Persistent `QueryException` errors due to the test environment attempting to connect to the MySQL database instead of the configured SQLite database.
*   **Configuration Loading:** Difficulties in ensuring that the `php artisan test` command correctly loads the testing environment configuration from `phpunit.xml` and `.env.testing`.
*   **Syntax Errors:** Accidental introduction of syntax errors in configuration files during our attempts to resolve the database connection issues.

Through persistent problem-solving, we've explored various solutions, including modifying `phpunit.xml`, `.env.testing`, `config/database.php`, and `config/cache.php`. The key takeaway is the importance of a robust and explicit configuration for the testing environment, especially in a complex setup like Laravel Sail on Windows. We also learned the importance of clearing the configuration cache (`php artisan config:clear`) after making changes to configuration files to ensure that the changes are applied.

### Next Steps

1.  **Run `CategoryApiTest.php`:** With the recent fixes to the configuration files, the next immediate step is to run the `CategoryApiTest.php` and ensure all tests pass. The tests that need to pass are:
    *   `test_guest_cannot_create_category`
    *   `test_regular_user_cannot_create_category`
    *   `test_admin_can_create_category`
    *   `test_categories_can_be_listed`
    *   `test_categories_can_be_listed_with_search_filter`
    *   `test_specific_category_can_be_retrieved`
    *   `test_guest_cannot_update_category`
    *   `test_regular_user_cannot_update_category`
    *   `test_admin_can_update_category`
    *   `test_guest_cannot_delete_category`
    *   `test_regular_user_cannot_delete_category`
    *   `test_admin_can_delete_category`

2.  **Complete Milestone 1.2:** Once the tests are passing, we will have completed the backend development for the Categories API. The final step for this milestone will be to mark it as complete in this `GEMINI.md` file.

3.  **Proceed to Milestone 1.3: Services API & UI Enhancement:** After completing Milestone 1.2, we will move on to the next milestone, which includes:
    *   Creating the `ServiceController` API.
    *   Adding routes for services CRUD.
    *   Implementing image uploads for services.
    *   Creating the `ServiceResource`.

This detailed plan will allow us to pick up where we left off and continue making progress efficiently in our next session.

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

*   PHP >= 8.2
*   Node.js and npm
*   Composer

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install PHP dependencies: `composer install`
3.  Install front-end dependencies: `npm install`
4.  Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`: `cp .env.example .env`
5.  Generate an application key: `php artisan key:generate`
6.  Configure your database in the `.env` file.
7.  Run database migrations and seed the database: `php artisan migrate --seed`

### Development

To start the development servers for both the back-end and front-end, run the following command:

```bash
composer run-script dev
```

This will start the Laravel development server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and the Vite development server on `http://localhost:5173`.

### Testing

To run the test suite, use the following command:

```bash
composer test
```

## Development Conventions

*   **Domain-Driven Design:** The application follows a domain-driven design approach, with services and models organized into domains.
*   **Service Layer:** Business logic is encapsulated in service classes.
*   **Blade Components:** The front-end uses Blade components for reusable UI elements.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling.
*   **Alpine.js:** Alpine.js is used for front-end interactivity.

*   **Clarification First:** Before implementing any feature or making a change, take a moment to clarify the requirements with the user. This ensures that we are building the right thing and avoids rework later. This is a crucial step to ensure we build everything right and well, even if it takes a little more time upfront.

*   **Domain-Centric Architecture:** Strictly adhere to the domain-driven design for all new files and modifications. Policies, HTTP controllers, form requests, and other related components must be placed within their respective domain directories (e.g., `app/Domains/Listings/Policies`, `app/Domains/Listings/Http/Controllers`, `app/Domains/Listings/Http/Requests`).
*   **Confidence Threshold:** Before making any changes, ensure you have at least 95% confidence in the approach and implementation. If unsure, ask follow-up questions for clarification.
*   **Domain-Driven Design Adherence:** Always prioritize adhering to the established Domain-Driven Design principles and project structure. New features and modifications should fit naturally within the existing domain boundaries.
*   **Master Plan First:** Refer to the 'Master Plan' as the primary source for tasks and priorities. Address items in the plan before considering new additions, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
*   **Clarification:** If any part of a task or instruction is unclear, ambiguous, or requires further detail, always ask follow-up questions to gain full understanding before proceeding.
*   **Testing:** For every new feature or bug fix, ensure appropriate unit and feature tests are written to verify correctness and prevent regressions. Tests are a permanent part of the codebase.
*   **Code Conventions:** Strictly follow existing code style, formatting, naming conventions, and architectural patterns observed in the project.
*   **Incremental Changes:** Prefer making small, focused, and verifiable changes. Avoid large, sweeping modifications that are difficult to review and debug.

## 🎯 Priority Levels

### P0 - Critical (Must Have for Launch)
- ✅ Phase 1: Core API (Services, Offers, Bids)
- ✅ Phase 2: Order System
- ✅ Phase 4: Payment Integration
- ✅ Phase 3.3: Messaging
- ✅ Phase 8.3: Email Notifications

### P1 - Important (Should Have)
- ✅ Phase 3.2: Real-time Notifications
- ✅ Phase 5.1-5.2: Verification & Reviews
- ✅ Phase 5.3-5.4: Disputes & Moderation
- ✅ Phase 7.2: Search

### P2 - Nice to Have (Can Be Post-Launch)
- 🔵 Phase 6: Quick Deals
- 🔵 Phase 7.1: Advanced Admin Dashboard
- 🔵 Phase 7.3: Activity Logs

---

## 📝 Technical Decisions Made

### Stack Confirmation
- **Backend:** Laravel 12.28.1 + PHP 8.2+
- **Frontend:** Blade + Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** MySQL 8.0+
- **Cache:** Redis
- **Queue:** Redis
- **Real-time:** Laravel Broadcasting + Pusher/Laravel WebSockets
- **Payments:** Xendit (primary choice for Philippines)

### Architecture Patterns
- Domain-Driven Design (existing structure)
- Service Layer for business logic
- Policy-based authorization
- Event-driven for real-time features
- Queue-based for async tasks

### Key Business Rules
- **Platform Fee:** Added on top of service price (e.g., 5%)
- **Payment Flow:** Buyer pays (price + fee) → Escrow → Released to seller (price - 0) after completion
- **Refunds:** Manual bank transfers for now
- **Cancellation:** Allowed only if no work started (no activity in WorkInstance)
- **Verification:** Manual review by admin/moderator
- **Disputes:** Simple system with admin resolution

---

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.
