## 📝 Technical Decisions Made

### Stack Confirmation
- **Backend:** Laravel 11 + PHP 8.2+
- **Frontend:** Blade + Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** MySQL 8.0+
- **Cache:** Redis
- **Queue:** Redis
- **Real-time:** Laravel Broadcasting + Pusher/Laravel WebSockets
- **Payments:** Xendit (primary choice for Philippines)

### Architecture Patterns
- Domain-Driven Design (existing structure)
- Service Layer for business logic
- Policy-based authorization
- Event-driven for real-time features
- Queue-based for async tasks

### Key Business Rules
- **Platform Fee:** Added on top of service price (e.g., 5%)
- **Payment Flow:** Buyer pays (price + fee) → Escrow → Released to seller (price - 0) after completion
- **Refunds:** Manual bank transfers for now
- **Cancellation:** Allowed only if no work started (no activity in WorkInstance)
- **Verification:** Manual review by admin/moderator
- **Disputes:** Simple system with admin resolution
