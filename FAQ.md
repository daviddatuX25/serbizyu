## 🛎️ Services & Listings

#### Q1: What is the difference between a "Service" and an "Open Offer"?
**A:** A **Service** is a pre-defined package of work offered by a seller at a set price (e.g., "Standard Home Cleaning for ₱1,500"). An **Open Offer** is a request made by a buyer for a custom job, where they set the budget and sellers bid to win the project (e.g., "Need a logo designed for my new business, budget is ₱3,000").

#### Q2: Can I add images or videos to my listings?
**A:** Yes, you can upload multiple images to your Service and Open Offer listings to provide more detail and attract more customers. Video uploads are a planned future feature.

#### Q3: What does "Pay First Required" mean?
**A:** When creating a service, a seller can toggle the "Pay First" option. If it's on, the buyer must complete payment before the seller can start the work. If it's off, the work can begin immediately, and payment is requested upon completion of the service workflow.

---

## 💸 Open Offers & Bidding

#### Q1: How do I create an Open Offer?
**A:** As a buyer, you can navigate to the "Open Offers" section and create a new offer by detailing your requirements, timeline, and budget.

#### Q2: How does bidding work?
**A:** As a seller, you can browse Open Offers and place a bid on any that you are qualified for. Your bid will include your proposed price and a reference to one of your existing services (to determine the workflow).

#### Q3: How do I accept a bid?
**A:** The buyer who created the Open Offer can review all bids they receive. When they accept a bid, a formal "Order" is automatically created based on the bid's terms, and the workflow begins.

## ⚙️ Orders & Workflows

#### Q1: What is a "Work Instance"?
**A:** A Work Instance is the execution environment for an order. It's where you track the step-by-step progress of the service, from start to finish.

#### Q2: What is an "Activity Thread"?
**A:** Within a work instance, sellers and buyers can create Activity Threads to communicate. These can be simple updates, questions, requests for evidence (like photos of completed work), or reports of an issue. Other users can then reply to these threads, creating a conversation around a specific topic.

#### Q3: What are "Strict Prompts"?
**A:** A seller can add a "Strict Prompt" (a required question) to a workflow step. This blocks the workflow from progressing to the next step until the designated person (either the buyer or the seller) provides an answer. This is useful for getting mandatory information before continuing.

## 📱 Quick Deals (QR Code)

#### Q1: What is a Quick Deal?
**A:** A Quick Deal is a feature that allows sellers to generate a unique QR code. When a customer scans this code, it initiates a real-time "session" where they can browse the seller's services and propose a deal on the spot.

#### Q2: What are the different Quick Deal modes?
**A:**
*   **Two-Way Mode (Default):** The most secure mode. When a customer scans the QR code, the seller must first approve the session before the customer can see the services. This prevents spam.
*   **One-Way Mode:** The customer can immediately see the services and start making proposals after scanning. This is faster but carries a higher risk of spam.

#### Q3: What happens when a proposal is accepted?
**A:** When one party accepts a proposal made within a Quick Deal session, an official "Order" is created instantly, and both users are redirected to the order page to begin the workflow.

## 💳 Payments & Payouts

#### Q1: How are payments handled?
**A:** The platform uses a simulated payment gateway (Xendit Demo) to handle online transactions. When a buyer pays, the funds are held in a simulated escrow until certain conditions are met (e.g., work completion).

#### Q2: What is a "Disbursement"?
**A:** A disbursement is the process of transferring a seller's earnings from their Serbizyu account to their personal bank account. This is scheduled automatically after an order is successfully completed and the clearing period has passed.

#### Q3: Is there a platform fee?
**A:** Yes, a small percentage-based platform fee is deducted from the total order amount. The fee is configurable and is used to maintain and improve the platform.

## 💬 Messaging

#### Q1: How many messaging systems are there?
**A:** There are three distinct communication systems:
1.  **Direct Messages:** For private, one-on-one conversations between any two users.
2.  **Contextual Threads:** For public or semi-private discussions attached to a specific item, like a Service or Open Offer listing.
3.  **Activity Threads:** For private communication between the buyer and seller within a specific order's work instance.

## ⭐ Reviews & Ratings

#### Q1: Can I leave a review?
**A:** Yes. After an order is completed, both the buyer and the seller can leave a review and a rating for each other. Buyers can also leave a review for the specific service listing they purchased.

#### Q2: Where can I see reviews?
**A:** User reviews are visible on a user's public profile. Service reviews are visible on the service listing page.

## 👤 Account & Profile

#### Q1: How do I manage my notification preferences?
**A:** In your profile settings, you can find a "Notification Preferences" section where you can enable or disable different types of notifications (e.g., new messages, bid alerts) for different channels (e.g., Email, In-App).

#### Q2: Can I add multiple addresses?
**A:** Yes, you can add multiple addresses to your profile and set one as your primary address. This is useful for specifying different locations for service delivery or pickup.

## 🛡️ Safety & Trust

#### Q1: How does Serbizyu handle disputes?
**A:** The platform has a reporting system where users can "flag" content or users for review by administrators. This includes flagging services, open offers, and even orders for issues like spam, fraud, or inappropriate content.

#### Q2: What is Escrow?
**A:** For online payments, the buyer's payment is held in a secure reserve (escrow). The funds are only released to the seller after the work is completed, providing a layer of protection for both parties.
